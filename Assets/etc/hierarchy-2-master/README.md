(NEW) New official hierarchy package now available on asset store - [Hierarchy 4](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/242660)

Hierarchy 2 free is now deprecated (This repo and also on asset store), i no longer update or add features to it.

Instead i create a paid [Hierarchy 4](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/242660) package (Now available on asset store), paid package allows me to spend more time on it, add new features, fix bugs, optimize, update soon when something changes, and make sure it work stably with Unity.

The [Hierarchy 4](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/242660) package guarantee support 2022.2.x and higher (Official support LTS, Normal version. Beta and Alpha if possible).
Also works with some LTS before 2022.2.x like Hierarchy 2 (But not guaranteed).

[Hierarchy 2 Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/hierarchy-2-166483) (Deprecated)

Don't hesitate to email me if you have any questions.
